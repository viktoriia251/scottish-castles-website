            <p class="about-castles__description">
                Scotland is home to hundreds of castles, ranging from grand fortresses to ruined remnants of the past. These castles have been military strongholds, royal homes, and symbols of power throughout history. Their presence reflects Scotland's turbulent history, with battles for independence and territorial control shaping the landscape.

Two of Scotland's most famous castles are Edinburgh Castle and Stirling Castle.

Edinburgh Castle, located on Castle Rock in the heart of Edinburgh, has been a central point in Scottish history since at least the 12th century. It served as a royal residence and military stronghold, witnessing numerous sieges and battles. Notable sights include the Stone of Destiny, used in royal coronations, and St. Margaret's Chapel, the oldest building in Edinburgh.

Stirling Castle, situated on a hill above the River Forth, was a crucial site in Scotland's medieval history. It played a key role in the Wars of Scottish Independence, including the famous Battle of Stirling Bridge. The castle was also the birthplace of Mary, Queen of Scots. Visitors can explore the Great Hall, Stirling Heads, and the restored Royal Palace.

These castles are not only important historical landmarks but also offer a fascinating insight into Scotland's royal heritage, medieval architecture, and resilience throughout centuries.
